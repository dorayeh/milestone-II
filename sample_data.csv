Despite providing appropriate documentation, specifically a copy of my driver 's license as proof of my correct address, XXXX has failed to make the necessary corrections. 

I have recently noticed that my credit report with XXXX contains an erroneous address, which is negatively impacting my financial standing. As a responsible consumer, I understand the importance of accurate credit reporting and the significant role it plays in various aspects of my life, including obtaining credit, securing housing, and even employment opportunities. 

To rectify this issue, I followed prescribed procedure by submitting a written request along with a copy of my driver 's license, clearly indicating my correct address. Unfortunately, XXXX Experian and XXXX each rejected my request without any valid justification, leaving my credit report with incorrect information. 

The refusal to correct my personal information violates several consumer protection laws, including but not limited to : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Under the FCRA, consumers have the right to dispute and request the correction of inaccurate information on their credit reports. Credit reporting agencies, such as XXXX, are legally obligated to investigate and correct any errors promptly. 

2. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) : FACTA provides consumers with the right to obtain and dispute their credit reports. It requires credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate information and investigate disputed items within a reasonable timeframe. 

3. Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) : The CFPA empowers the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to take appropriate action against financial institutions that engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices, including inaccurate reporting of personal information. 

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intervene in this matter, investigate the actions of XXXX, and ensure that they comply with the aforementioned consumer protection laws. Additionally, I urge you to direct XXXX to correct my credit report promptly by updating my address to the accurate information provided. 


I appreciate your attention to this serious issue and request your prompt assistance in rectifying the inaccuracies on my credit report. I look forward to a favorable resolution and the restoration of my accurate personal information. 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
